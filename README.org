* Polybar-IBus
  A simple [[https://github.com/polybar/polybar/][polybar]] module for [[https://github.com/ibus/ibus/wiki/ReadMe][Input Bus]] users.

** Features
   - A more precise and suitable status for IBus
   - [[https://github.com/ibus/ibus-m17n][m17n]] or other input engines support
   - Capslock and Numlock support
   - Shortcuts for quickly switching engines and opening IBus setting panel
     with mouse left click and right click
   - No systray needed
   - More to come

   Currently, this module don't work very smoothly like [[https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki/Module:-xkeyboard][xkeyboard]] in
   the official polybar modules. It takes time to communicate with
   =ibus-daemon=. Therefore, there are a 3~5 seconds delay to toggle the
   status change :/ If you only use xkeyboard(xkb), I strongly suggest
   you use the official module without IBus.

** Requirement(s)
   - ibus(ibus-daemon/ibus-setup)
   - rofi
     There is a great chance that they are already in your distro's
     official/community/user repositories. If not, download, build and
     install from [[https://github.com/ibus/ibus][IBus]] and [[https://github.com/davatorium/rofi][Rofi]]'s source.

** Usage
   First, you need to make sure that =ibus-daemon= is running. You can
   use =pgrep -x ibus-daemon= to check.
   Move =scripts/= to =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/polybar/= if you don't
   have this directory; otherwise, move all the scripts to the already
   existed =scripts/= directory. Keep in mind that the scripts need to
   be under =scripts/= to work.
   #+begin_src shell
   # assume that the directory doesn't exist and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is $HOME/.config
   $ mv scripts/ ~/.config/polybar
   #+end_src

   Copy the content below to your polybar configuration
   file(=config/config.ini=...).
   #+begin_src ini
[module/ibus]
type = custom/script

exec = ~/.config/polybar/scripts/ibus-engine.sh &
; you need to run ibus-daemon first for the script to work
exec-if = pgrep -x ibus-daemon

tail = true

format-background = ${color.mb}

format-padding = ${layout.module-padding}

click-left = ~/.config/polybar/scripts/ibus-switch.sh &
click-right = ~/.config/polybar/scripts/ibus-setting.sh &
   #+end_src ini
Change =scripts/ibus-engine.sh= to use your favorite icons/glyphs. Optionally,
you can take a look at and load the font I use(in =fonts/=) into your
system(Don't forget to modify your font configuration in =config=).

That's it! Then you can:
    - change the engine using keyboard shortcuts defined in IBus
      setting to see the status in polybar.
    - Left-click to get an available engines menu with rofi(You need to
      set them in Ibus setting first)
    - Right-click to open IBus setting.

** Description
   The module is able to show up to 3 fields on the polybar when the
   user toggles an IBus engine. They are engine type, keyboard layout
   ,as well as its variant(if any) and language.

   Let's take American dvorak keyboard(in IBus, xkb:us:dvorak:eng) for example:
   - engine type: xkb(X keyboard)
   - keyboard layout: us; variant: dvorak
   - language: eng(English)
   So your polybar will show:
#+begin_src
   [icon] xkb [icon] us - dvorak [icon] eng
#+end_src
   Engine type always exists, while the other three don't. So you may
   see some engines show only one or two fields(i.e. rime):
#+begin_src
   [icon] rime [icon] sys
#+end_src
   It's worth knowing that Ibus might remap keyboard and shadow
   settings from =setxkbmap= to some extent. If you don't want to use
   IBus's keyboard layout, you can set up IBus to use system's
   layout(=ibus-setup= or right click the module on polybar). This way,
   polybar will show sys as keyboard layout.

*** Format used when switching engines
    If you left click on the module, you will be given a rofi menu
    asking you what engine you would like to use. However, the format
    of each engine name is a bit strange. In fact, the format is
    IBus's engine name, and the four fields separated by colons
    matches the three fields mentioned above, with the first field being the
    engine type, the second and third being the layout, and the last
    field being the language.
    For example:
#+begin_src
    xkb:ru::rus
    xkb:ru:phonetic:rus
    m17n:ru:phonetic
#+end_src
    They are, respectively:
    - Russian Keyboard(Xkeyboard)
    - Russian Phonetic Keyboard(Xkeyboard)
    - Russian Phonetic Keyboard(m17n)

    Intended to keep the scripts simple and short, I decided this is
    currently the best way to list engines in a menu(if you know a
    better way, welcome to leave a PR!), since if you can read the
    status displayed by polybar, you should be able to understand
    these entries.

** TODO TODO [0/3]
  - [-] implement shortcuts for ibus-emoji.
  - [-] make the scripts faster and more efficient.
  - [-] provide a more human-readable menu for engine selection
